*“Imitation is the first instinct of the awakening mind.” - Maria Montessori*



As a parent, you have one of the most rewarding duties; you raise an individual capable of developing their own agency. One with their own mannerisms, temperament and traits which might match up or differ from yours. Embracing your child completely will strengthen their attachment to you and your relationship with your child will shape how they interact with others.



Before you can help your child discover himself and the world around him, you need to understand yourself. You are a collection of experiences that determine how you act and think. This paves the road for your parenthood journey. One must understand that your traits will become the building blocks that shape your child’s reality and you have to learn from your past to enhance your child’s future.



To truly review and reflect on yourself, you can answer questions that shaped your past and personality. Your child will imitate you more often than not so it’s important to know how your actions and words reach your child. You can not expect order out of chaos. You must condition your own emotions and thoughts to compliment the goals you have for your child.



Getting to know yourself will benefit your role as parent. Use these questions to delve into who you are.
