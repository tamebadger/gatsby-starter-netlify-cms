Kids don’t need things nearly as much as they need a parent’s attention and availability. It’s a classic mistake that we make all too often; we give them stuff we’ve bought instead of the thing they most need from us – our interest and investment in them.

Or we do things for them instead of with them – like lock them out of the garage while we assemble the new bicycle or shoo them out the kitchen while we bake a masterpiece for their birthday. We tell ourselves that these activities show how much we love them, but the truth is, nothing counts as much as simple TIME spent with them.

What’s true in parenting is also true in marriage. Our relationships thrive when we give them our time and attention. When we reflect back over our more than 30 years together (28 of them married), the periods which stand out as our highlights are also the periods when we were spending the most time together.

For example, our relationship flourished in our first six months of dating despite living in different cities because we spent so much time writing love letters, working our casual jobs to pay for phone calls and planning for the brief moments we were together.
